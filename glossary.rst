    Analytics attribute
        :term:`Attribute` generated from value provided by :term:`Analytics` (e.g. browser and device data, location
        data, etc.). You can read more about :term:`attribute` sources
        `here <https://help.piwik.pro/audience-manager/data-sources/>`_.

        .. note::
            If :term:`custom attribute` uses the same name - it will be represented as a separate :term:`attribute`.

    Analytics ID

        browser cookie.

    Application
        Website or application tracked by PPAS.

    App ID
        PPAS :term:`application` identificator (previously **website ID**, **site ID** or **idSite**).

    Attribute
        Named value assigned to :term:`visitor` profile.

    Attribute whitelist
        List of :term:`visitor` :term:`attributes<attribute>` that are publicly available via Audience Manager API.

            It is still necessary to identify the :term:`visitor` with his :term:`analytics ID` to access this information.

    Audience
        Named set of :term:`attribute` conditions used to define a group of :term:`visitors<visitors>` matching them.

    Custom attribute
        :term:`Attribute` generated from value provided by source other than :term:`Analytics` (e.g.
        :doc:`audience_manager/form-tracker`, :doc:`sdk/index`). You can read more about :term:`attribute` sources
        `here <https://help.piwik.pro/audience-manager/data-sources/>`_.

        .. warning::
            :term:`Custom attribute` will store only latest value provided by any custom source.

        .. note::
            If :term:`analytics attribute` uses the same name - it will be represented as a separate :term:`attribute`.

    Tracker (Tracker backend)

    JavaScript Tracking Client (JSTC)
        A JavaScript object that is able to send requests to :term:`Tracker`. It is loaded and created with download of `ppms.js` file. It has an :ref:`API<data-collection-javascript-tracking-client-api>` that allows to configure what data requests should contain. You can :ref:`learn more about JSTC here<data-collection-javascript-tracking-client-installation>`

    JavaScript Tracking Snippet (JSTS)
