    Get user profile attributes
  description: |
    Returns a list of user profile attributes.

    In order to secure the PII data, no attribute is returned by default. You need to put each attribute you want to
    access on the attribute whitelist before itâ€™ll be returned by this endpoint. In order to do that, go to
    `Audience Manager` > `Attributes` tab and `enable` attribute for the public API access. It is your responsibility to
    make sure no user PII data will be available via API.
