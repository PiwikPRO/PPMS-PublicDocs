Reporting API (deprecated)
==========================

.. warning:: On September '20 weâ€™ll disable Analytics (classic) API for all cloud customers. The tracking API will remain as is. We recommend you to switch to Analytics (new) :ref:`custom-reports-http-api` as soon as possible. For more, see the `API migration guide <https://help.piwik.pro/support/migrate/analytics-new-api-migration-guide/>`_

This API gives access to your analytics reports.

A short description of all available reports is available in :term:`Analytics`. Follow these instructions to access it:

#. Login into your PPAS instance
#. Go to `Menu` > `Analytics settings`.
