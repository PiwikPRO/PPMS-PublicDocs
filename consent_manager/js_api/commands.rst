Commands
--------
All commands work in context of the current visitor and website. Additionally they sometimes require communication with a PPAS server and are asynchronous. Callback functions are used to provide response value or information about errors. ``onSuccess(...args)`` callback is required, with the exception of ``openConsentForm`` command where it is optional. ``onFailure(exception)`` callback is optional and if is specified, any error object occurred will be passed as a argument. If not specified, error is reported directly on console output.

Get compliance types
````````````````````
Fetches a list of consent types.

Code::

    ppms.cm.api('getComplianceTypes', onFulfilled, onRejected);
    dataLayer.push({'event': 'ppms.cm:getComplianceTypes', parameters: [onFulfilled, onRejected]});

:func:`dataLayer.push` interface is only for backward compatibility and you can read more about this particular case below. We recommend :func:`ppms.cm.api`.

.. function:: onFulfilled(types)

    **required** The fulfilment handler callback (called with result).

    :param Array<string> types: **Required** Array of consent types

        Example::

            ["remarketing", "analytics"]

.. function:: onRejected(error)

    The rejection handler callback (called with error code). If not specified, exception will be thrown in main stacktrace.

    :param string|object error: **Required** Error code or exception.

Get new compliance types
````````````````````````
Fetches a list of new consent types which were appearing after given consents.

Code::

    ppms.cm.api('getNewComplianceTypes', onFulfilled, onRejected);
    dataLayer.push({'event': 'ppms.cm:getNewComplianceTypes', parameters: [onFulfilled, onRejected]});

This API command might be useful to note that user has seen a popup with consents but didn't make a decision (popup was closed).
After successful, Consent Manager internally sends only to stats endpoint an information that user has seen consents.
Result from getNewComplianceTypes method can be passed directly.

Code::

    ppms.cm.api('setInitialComplianceSettings', settings, onFulfilled, onRejected);
    dataLayer.push({'event': 'ppms.cm:setInitialComplianceSettings', parameters: [settings, onFulfilled, onRejected]});

.. object:: settings

    **required** The consent settings object.

        Example::

            {consents: ['analytics']}

        or

        Example::

.. function:: onFulfilled()

     **required** The fulfilment handler callback. This function is **required**.

.. function:: onRejected(error)

    The rejection handler callback (called with error code). If not specified, exception will be thrown in main stacktrace.

    :param string|object error: **Required** Error code or exception.

Set compliance settings

This API command might be useful when user interact with custom, extended UI that reacts on user approve/reject action.
After successful, Consent Manager internally send consent settings to tracking server and force page view on tags.
Additionally information to statistics is sent about user decisions.

Code::

    ppms.cm.api('setComplianceSettings', settings, onFulfilled, onRejected);
    dataLayer.push({'event': 'ppms.cm:setComplianceSettings', parameters: [settings, onFulfilled, onRejected]});

:func:`dataLayer.push` interface is only for backward compatibility and you can read more about this particular case below. We recommend :func:`ppms.cm.api`.

.. object:: settings

    **required** The consent settings object.

        Example::

            {consents: {analytics: {status: 1}}}

    * ``1`` - user has approved the consent

.. function:: onFulfilled()

     **required** The fulfilment handler callback. This function is **required**.

.. function:: onRejected(error)

    The rejection handler callback (called with error code). If not specified, exception will be thrown in main stacktrace.

    dataLayer.push({'event': 'ppms.cm:getComplianceSettings', parameters: [onFulfilled, onRejected]});
