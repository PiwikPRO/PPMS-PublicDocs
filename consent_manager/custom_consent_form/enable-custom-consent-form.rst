Enable custom consent form
--------------------------

Consent Manager's JS API enables you to build a custom consent form in place of the default one.

To turn on Custom consent form mode:

  #. Go to Administration module
  #. Go to “Websites & apps” tab
  #. In “Settings” section, find “Privacy” settings
  #. Ensure that “Ask visitors for consent” is checked
  #. Enable “Use a custom consent form” option

Then you can build a form using the `JavaScript API`_.
