Enable custom consent form
--------------------------

Consent Manager's JS API enables you to build a custom consent form in place of the default one.

To turn on Custom consent form mode:

  #. Go to the Administration module
  #. Go to `Sites & apps` tab
  #. Choose your site or app from the sidebar
  #. Ensure that `Ask visitors for consent` is turned on
  #. In the `Consent` section, find `Consent settings` and click `View`
  #. Enable the `Use a custom consent form` option
  #. Click `Save`

Then you can build a form using the `JavaScript API`_.
