#TODO: OpenAPI v2 doesn't allow JSON items serialization. There may be a way to represent it in v3 (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/437), but Redoc isn't ready for it yet. Using items definition also allows specifying item definition (type and description). If we want to have cleaner documentation it may be worth it to consider if any of supported serializers could be added as new suggested format or if we can push for inclusion of JSON serializer into standard (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#fixed-fields-7 serialization options are described in "collectionFormat").
#TODO: Confirm that term "Visitor" should be used when referring to user of tracked site.
