Authorization
=============

If you want to access API for the first time, you need to generate your API credentials and use them to create an access token. The token is needed to authenticate API calls.

Our API uses [client credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) (OAuth grant type) for obtaining a user token. All data is sent and received as JSON and is compliant with the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification.
