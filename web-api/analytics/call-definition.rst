API call definition
===================

When you want to query your database, you can use an API call definition in Piwik PRO. The definition is avaliable for each report inside Piwik PRO. Just make a few clicks and have your API call ready.

To fetch data directly from a report, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Piwik PRO.
2. Go to **Menu** > **Analytics**.
3. Navigate to **Reports**, **Custom reports**, **Goals**, or **Ecommerce**.
4. On the left, click a report that you want to work with.
5. Click the three-dot icon next to the report section that you want to use.
6. Click **View API call definition**.
7. Copy an **API endpoint** or **API query**.
